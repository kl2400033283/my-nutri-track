## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082), evoking a sense of depth and mystery to complement the 3D animation.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), nearly white, to allow the 3D element and primary color to stand out.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#BF00FF), to highlight interactive elements and draw the user's eye.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for its clean, modern appearance and readability.
- Use simple, minimalist icons for input fields and buttons to not distract from the 3D animation.
- Center the login form on the screen, with the 3D element positioned to draw focus. Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout.
- Smooth, fluid animations for the 3D element's movements and reactions to user interactions, enhancing the immersive experience.
