    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to be simple and secure, focusing on user data. User data is stored in a path-based structure under `/users/{userId}`. This structure facilitates straightforward ownership-based security rules. The structure ensures Authorization Independence as the authorization check only relies on `request.auth.uid` and the path. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules and allows for atomic operations. Since all documents in the `users` collection share the same security requirements (only the authenticated user can access their own data), Structural Segregation is achieved. QAPs are supported because listing operations on `/users/{userId}` are secure as they are always scoped to the authenticated user's ID."
